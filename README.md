MeetingMinutes
==============

Notes taken at our Meetings since 2/11/2014

If you are going to contribute to the notes, please follow the guidelines below:

* File extension must be .md (preferred) or .txt - no Word documents or PDFs
* Place file in appropriate folder for the month. If the folder doesn't exist, create one
* Name the file as [Short Month] [Date].md . Eg: Feb 11.md (use Markdown formatting, but .txt is acceptable in a pinch)
